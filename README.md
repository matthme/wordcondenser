The Word Condenser is a Holochain App designed to collectively condense latent [term that yet needs to be condensed] dissolved in the grammatical space of human collectives.

Just as glasses condense water droplets dissolved in warm humid air when entering a cozy pub in winter, the Word Condenser condenses words and sayings that are latently dissolved across the humid space of human experience and imagination.

## Out there it is...

<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
  If your mind has not yet blown, then let me tell you this:<br>
  Isn't it neat that now we have,<br>
  sattelites that orbit and that scan,<br>
  our planet of language - just as it is.<br>
  (And read those very lines you bet<br>
  before your eyes them now just met)<br>
  <br>

  With names as warm and cute as seven,<br>
  letters in a row together,<br>
  with three of them in emphasize -<br>
  "GPT" that is -<br>
  and chat is what they seem to do.<br>
  <br>

  They seem to make us realize,<br>
  to our surprised and genuine amaze,<br>
  how finite it is - this globe of ours,<br>
  when looking from outside.<br>
  <br>

  However listen - here comes the clue,<br>
  has ever been in space, the person that are you?<br>
  I admit that stories heard I only have myself,<br>
  but with sincerity I have been told:<br>
  "Out there it is damn f***ing cold!"<br>
  <br>

  So grab your stuff, don't hesitate,<br>
  with this new knowledge in your mind,<br>
  of paths and trails yet unexplored,<br>
  and come with me and us instead,<br>
  <br>

  being curious and keen about,<br>
  the warmth that we shall find together,<br>
  around the corners next to us,<br>
  we haven't thought of looking ever.<br>
</div>
